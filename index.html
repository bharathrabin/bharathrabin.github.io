			<h1>Hello</h1>
			<p>
				I am Bharath, a Software Engineer currently employed at Delivery Hero SE. My primary focus is on Vendor Operations, ensuring that our restaurants and partners have a seamless experience in maintaining their data on our platform. Before joining Delivery Hero, I earned my M.Sc in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/en/">TU Berlin</a>. From February 2017 to December 2019, I worked at <a href="https://www.teraki.com/">Teraki</a> Gmbh, initially as a Data Scientist and later as a Software Developer. Prior to that, I completed my B.Sc at Constructor University, formerly known as Jacobs University Bremen. My interests span the intersection of Theoretical Computer Science, Systems Software, and Machine Learning. In my free time, I enjoy blogging about projects I implement, papers I read, and notes I take."

				Outside of professional activities, I love exploring music. Currently, I am delving into the breadth of what electronic music has to offer. I am a self-taught DJ and enjoy mixing Bass music, UKG, House, and Techno. I am passionate about tennis and football. I am a diehard Liverpool F.C. fan, but I am always interested in a game of  regardless of which teams are playing. Additionally, I enjoy cooking, mostly for others; it isn't the same when I cook for myself. Lastly, I like catching up with friends.
