			<h3> <u>About Me</u></h3>
			<p>
				I completed my undergraduate degree from Jacobs University in early 2017. I worked full time from 2017 to 2018 before reentering university for graduate programme. My interests lie at the intersection of Theoretical Computer Science and Machine Learning. Most of my courses that I have completed in my degree relate to one of these two fields of computing. I recently started blogging about topics that I often think about. Do head over and check out my blog. And do contact me if you'd like to chat about these topics.
			</p>
			<p>
				Outside professional activities, I love exploring various genres of music. Currently, I am exploring the breadth of what electronic music has to offer. I am a self-taught DJ and I enjoy mixing bass music, broken beats, house (and associated sub-genres) and techno. I am crazy about football, tennis and I am a diehard Liverpool F.C. fan. Always down to watch a game of footie as a neutral. I enjoy cooking (mostly for others, it isn't the same when I cook for myself) and catching up with friends.
